      <description>This is my first post on GitHub Pages. This personal blog is powered by Colorie - Jekyll theme, which is an elegant theme.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m not a native English speaker, there are supposed to be some mistakes in linguistics, such as grammar or spell mistakes, though I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with Online Translation when writing.
For more detailed information please refer to the ABOUT page. In short, these blogs are taken down for reviewing and sharing, hoping to be helpful.</description>
